This is a complex number calculator Implemented using Operator Overloading.
Operator Overloading makes it easier to deal with mathematical operations
on the objects in this case.

This program was made during a class as a test of concept understanding, and is
still to be improved and to be made a fully functional Complex number calculator
catering for all the basic mathematical operations done to complex numbers.
